# pi2StrainMapping
This repo is designed to complete a StrainMapping project where experimental STM data of tBLG moire superlattice sites are transformed into k-space lattice sites.
A simulated lattice site generating function is then fit to the data and the input parameters are optimized until minimal difference between simulated and experimental 
lattice site locations are achieved.


The compact version of this code is designed only for an specific input data, namely data1 in the repo. The generalized version serves to work as a global program that is compatible with any STM jpeg image and can fully return ideal strain parameters given any input image.
