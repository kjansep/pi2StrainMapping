# pi2StrainMapping
This repo is designed to complete a StrainMapping project where experimental STM data of tBLG moire superlattice sites are transformed into k-space lattice sites.
A simulated lattice site generating function is then fit to the data and the input parameters are optimized until minimal difference between simulated and experimental 
lattice site locations are achieved.
